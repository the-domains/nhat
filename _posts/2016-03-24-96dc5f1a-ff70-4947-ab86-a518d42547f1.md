description: "Bio: No Honor Among Thieves is exactly what you didn't see coming out of the Connecticut Hardcore Scene. \_Or, maybe its exactly what you were hoping would happen. \_Four musicians with four different backgrounds blend together to create a sound that echoes the sounds of the past, while looking toward tomorrow. \_They sew together progressive song structures, breakdowns of mammoth proportions and furious tempo changes that ensure you don't know what lies around the next corner. \_As if the riffs weren't enough, these progressive punks bring a live show that commands the attention of everyone in attendance. \_There's melody, there's brutality, there's intensity, there's message, there's emotion, but most of all, there's feeling. \_No Honor Among Thieves is a spiraling aural autobiography of it's members, pouring their hearts out to the listener via their medium of choice, sound."

_Bio: No Honor Among Thieves is exactly what you didn't see coming out of the Connecticut Hardcore Scene.  Or, maybe its exactly what you were hoping would happen.  Four musicians with four different backgrounds blend together to create a sound that echoes the sounds of the past, while looking toward tomorrow.  They sew together progressive song structures, breakdowns of mammoth proportions and furious tempo changes that ensure you don't know what lies around the next corner.  As if the riffs weren't enough, these progressive punks bring a live show that commands the attention of everyone in attendance.  There's melody, there's brutality, there's intensity, there's message, there's emotion, but most of all, there's feeling.  No Honor Among Thieves is a spiraling aural autobiography of it's members, pouring their hearts out to the listener via their medium of choice, sound._
